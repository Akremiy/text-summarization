# Text Summarization Tool

This project implements a simple text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with the NLTK library. The tool reads a text file, processes the content, and generates a summary by extracting significant sentences.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install the NLTK package:**
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. **Download NLTK resources:**
   The script automatically downloads necessary NLTK resources. If you encounter any issues, you can manually download them by running:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

## Usage

1. Create a text file named `input.txt` in the root directory of the project and populate it with the text you want to summarize. The text can be any written content, such as an article, essay, or report.

   **Example of `input.txt`:**
   ```
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human languages in a valuable way.
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The summary will be printed to the console.

## Features

- Tokenizes input text into words and sentences.
- Removes common stopwords to focus on significant words.
- Scores sentences based on word frequency.
- Generates a summary by extracting sentences with scores above a calculated average.

## File Structure

```
